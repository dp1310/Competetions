 * Prateek and Chintu are working on different projects both with equal priority.
 * They both need to run some batches of processes. A batch has processes which
 * need some systems to run them irrespective of the number of process running
 * on each dependent system. If a batch runs then the dependent systems are
 * occupied by its processes. No system can run processes from different
 * projects and thus a system can process only chintu's processes or prateek's
 * processes. Their manager being a stylo creep has allowed prateek to run his
 * batches. Chintu felt offended and complained the CTO directly due to which
 * the manager came up with a condition that if chintu can increase the number
 * of processes running in total by replacing some or all of prateeks processes
 * then only he can run his batches. Chintu wants to maximize the total
 * processes running in order to show the manager his skills. Help him complete
 * his task.

    Note:

    A system can run any number of process from multiple batches at the same time
    but only of Chintu or of Prateek.

    Prateek's processes are running on some or all systems. Now, chintu has to run
     his batches of processes inorder to increase the number of running processes
    across all systems. A batch of chintu either runs all its processes or doesn't
     run any of them.

    If Chintu has replaced a system with his own processes then another batch of
     him can run its processes on that system.

    A batch needs 's' systems and runs 'p' processes overall, in any manner.
