 * problem: Counting Good Partitions of a String
 * Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/101hack25/challenges/counting-good-partitions-of-a-string
 *
 * let's say string's character set is charSet {a, b, c, d, ...}.
 * and their occurance count is {p, q, r, s, ...}
 * for good partitions every partition must have distinct first char.
 * we know that the first partition has to start from the first char of the string.
 * if we fix the first character for all the partition the length is fixed (as the
 * first character of next partition is fixed).
 * we can choose a partition with first character as b (second from the set, not
 * to be confused with the second alphabet 'b') in q ways (count of b).
 * similarly a partition with first character as c (again not to be confused with
 * the third alphabet in roman script 'c') in r ways.
 * so total number of good partitions q * r * s * ...
 * Note that you can't say that the character z is not present in the string so
 * the count for z is zero. If z is not present in string then z is not part of
 * charSet of string.
 * I hope it was helpful.
